Full User Guide
===============

| If quantum physics sounds challenging to you, you are not alone. All
  of our intuitions are based on day-to-day experiences and are defined
  by classical physics — so most of us find the concepts in quantum
  physics counterintuitive at first. In order to comprehend the quantum
  world, you must let go of your beliefs about our physical world, and
  develop an intuition for a completely different (and often surprising)
  set of laws.

Our goal with the IBM Quantum Experience is to introduce this world
through a set of short tutorials in our User Guide, and by providing the
hands-on opportunity to experiment with operations on a real quantum
computing processor. This way, we hope to foster a quantum intuition in
the greater community, and spark further interest in those who are
curious. By making quantum concepts more widely understood—even on a
general level— we can more deeply explore all the possibilities quantum
computing offers, and more rapidly bring its exciting power to a world
whose perspective is limited by classical physics.
